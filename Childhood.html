        <h2>The Family</h2>
        
        <p><strong>[Father]</strong> Tom Sweeny was born August 13, 1924.  He was raised in Medford, MA, a town that bordered Boston.  Tom was one of three.  His older sister died of pneumonia at a very young age.  He also had a younger brother, Bill.  In high school, he skied and was a lightweight boxer.  He attended Boston College where he was captain of the ski team.  Tom Sweeny went on to become a Colonel in the United States Army and was stationed in France and then Germany.  He was also sent to Korea during the Korean War.  In his later years, he stayed part of the National Guard.  He was also an insurance agent as his everyday job.  He had two children, two dogs, and three cats over his lifetime.  Tom passed away on June 21, 2009 at age 85. </p>

	<p><strong>[Mother]</strong> Joan Sweeny was born on June 1, 1927.  She was raised in Brooklyn, NY.  She attended Saint Saviour High School.  She was also a teen model for Ford Models in NYC.  She was seen in print work for Dior, Macy’s, and Yves Saint Laurent.  She attended Manhattanville College (while it was still in Manhattan).  She majored in History.  Later in life, she gave birth to Ann in 1956 and adopted her son, Tom Sweeny Jr. in 1962 with her husband.  She has always been very active.  In her later years, she participates in Meals on Wheels delivering food to elderly people who are unable to help themselves.  She runs a daycare at the local church, and she is at every single one of her grandkid’s athletic competitions. At 85 years old, she is still as active as ever.</p>

	<p><strong>[Brother]</strong> Thomas Sweeny Jr. was adopted into the family in 1962.  He was, as the family jokes “a jolly fellow” even as a young child.  He and Ann were six years apart.  Tom attended Wayland High School where he played lacrosse and football.  He went on to the University of Colorado where he picked up the beloved family cat, Randy (who lived even into my day).  He then transferred to the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  He married his wife Melissa Montgomery in 1988 and they had three children.  He is a software consultant.</p>
