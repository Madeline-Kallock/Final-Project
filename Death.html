        <h3>Ann's last journey.</h3>
        </div>
        <p>At 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, July 31, 2012, Ann took her final breath.  She and her daughter had always been huge Harry Potter fanatics and it was quite a coincidence that she passed away on Harry Potter’s birthday.  Her mother, Joan Sweeny, was with Ann when she passed away that morning.</p>
        
        <p>Her wake was attended by so many people.  It made things so much easier to hear how Ann had touched so many people’s lives.  She was such an incredible force of nature.  She never let anything get her down.</p>
        
        <p>The funeral was short but left a lasting impression.  After, attendees were invited to a luncheon where her loved ones were invited up to tell stories about their friend and loved one Ann.</p>
