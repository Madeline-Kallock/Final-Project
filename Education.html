      <h2>High School</h2>
      
      <p>Ann attended Wayland High School after attending eight years of Catholic school.  Her best friends Liz Albert and Jamie Stone remained her close friends her entire life.  She was part of the Student Government, which her senior year included arranging a concert with the band Aerosmith (a hometown band) where the members of the Student Government got to meet the band.  She was captain of the Swim Team and a nationally ranked diver.  She was very dedicated to her diving.  She said however that she always wished she could have been an actual swimmer but she was “too lazy to actually swim that much,”.  Ann was also the captain and MVP of her Ski Team.  She graduated Wayland High School in 1974.</p>

      <p>Ann Sweeny attended the College of the Holy Cross from 1974 to 1978.  She was a History major.  She was part of the first women’s Swim and Diving Team.  She was very dedicated to her studies.  She met one of her best friends Subrina Wood when they realized their shared love of film.  Although their one disagreement was that Ann was a fan of Woody Allen and Subrina was very much the opposite.  Her junior year, Ann did a semester in Washington D.C. and interned at the Library of Congress.  Her senior year, Ann lived off campus in a house with her best friends, Subrina Wood, Lynn Ustach, Carol Laves, and Terri Breston.  She received her Bachelors degree in History. </p>
      
      <h2>Graduate School</h2>
      
      <h3>University of Washington</h3>
      
      <p>Ann attended the University of Washington in Seattle from 1978 to 1980.  During her time there, Mount St Helens erupted towards the end of her last year in Washington.  She received her Masters in History after writing her 30-page thesis.</p>

      <h3>Simmons College</h3>
      
      <p>Ann went back to school at Simmons College to receive her Masters in Library Science.  She had always been an excellent researcher, but in her time at Simmons she honed those skills to perfection.  She was working at the Harvard Law Library and they offered to pay half her tuition if she went back to school.  She graduated in 1986.</p>
      
      <h2>Law School</h2>
      
      <p>Ann had always wanted to be a lawyer for as long as I can remember.  For a long time, I had the same aspiration until I saw what she went through.  In 2004, Ann started her long journey to become what she had always wanted to be.</p>

	<p>Ann took the bar in the winter of 2004 and her scores were so good, she even received a scholarship that she didn’t even apply for from the New England School of Law.  In the end, she chose Suffolk Law School in Boston, MA.  She started in the fall of 2005, the same year I started my journey through high school.</p>

	<p>She made the Trial Team her second year.  The Trial Team was a very select group of students (both night and day students) chosen to compete against other schools.  Each team is given a case and put on either the prosecution or the defense.  There were also independent competitions that Ann also competed in.  She was the last female left for the Northeast region. </p> 

	<p>In the spring of 2009, Ann’s father was hospitalized.  In the days before her graduation, he became very sick and we weren’t sure if he was going to make it.  In the end, he re-stabilized and Ann made it back to Boston for her graduation.  She walked across the stage (without her glasses) and somehow did not trip.  Seeing her graduate was one of the proudest moments of my life.  She graduated with a Juris Doctor degree.</p>

    <p>While studying to take the bar, Ann’s father passed away.  She caught up with her classes online while also helping her mother arrange the wake and funeral.  </p>

<p>On October 28, 2009, Ann Sweeny Kallock passed the bar on her FIRST attempt.  It is more common to fail on your first try than to pass.  Even when dealing with the death of her father, she still managed to do what she had to do.  </p>
