        <h1>Cancer</h1>
        
        <h2>Breast Cancer</h2>
        
        <p>In 1999, Ann was diagnosed with stage two-breast cancer.  There had been	 no history of it before in the family.</p>
        
        <p>Ann fought the cancer with incredible strength.  She started her chemotherapy as soon as possible.  She started to lose her hair and asked her husband to shave it off so that she could just get it over with.  She kept to her day-to-day activities and tried her best to explain to her seven-year-old daughter what was going on.  She did not understand why her mom was throwing up every day and wearing hats all the time.  Ann sat her down and explained it all and then took her along to the wig store where she picked one out.  Maddie wanted to be like her mom too so she picked out a wig that the storeowners gave to her.</p>
        
        <p>Ann survived and there was never a sign of the cancer staying in her body.  After having cancer this time, she did however begin to look at life a little differently.</p>
        
        <h2>Cancer Strikes Again!</h2>
        
        <p>For much of the spring in 2010, Ann had suffered through much discomfort and pain.  For anyone that knew her, you know that she only did things when she wanted.  She was very stubborn so even after pleas from family to go to the doctor, she refused.  She credited the pain and discomfort to being overly stressed out at work.</p>
        
        <p>In August of 2010, Ann went to the Bahamas with her daughter.  During that trip she still felt the pain and it was decided that she would have to go to the doctor when she returned home.</p>

        <p>At the end of August, the weekend before her daughter was supposed to go back to school for her sophomore year, Ann went in for her colonoscopy.  Her husband was out of town on business so her daughter had to drive her to the hospital.  She went in for her procedure and after only 40 minutes she was out.  The doctor came out and told her daughter that there had been a blockage and they were doing a biopsy of the mass.  Maddie went into see Ann and she knew that it was cancer again.</p>
        
        <p>Ann was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon/Rectal cancer.  She endured several different kinds of chemo and underwent radiation twice.  The radiation was the most painful because of the location of the cancer.  Radiation is essentially a laser that is targeted at the tumor.  The radiation however, was also affecting other areas so it was as if as Ann described it, her insides were being burned.</p>
        
        <p>In November 2010, Ann was put on an all-liquid diet for two weeks.  By the time Thanksgiving came around, she was at her breaking point.  She was hospitalized two days after and had to have surgery.</p>

        <h2>Summer 2012</h2>
        
        <p>Things started to get better up until the beginning of summer 2012.  Ann was put onto a new kind of chemotherapy.  It was once every two weeks but it sucked the life out of her and it took nearly 10 days for her body to recover.  She still continued to work on her pro bono cases because that was what really made her happy.</p>
        
        <p>The weekend of July 12, 2012, her daughter went off to a music festival and her old college friend Lynn came to visit.  She shopped, went to some museums and went and got a glass of wine or two.  Everyday calling her daughter to casually chat.  She had won her most recent pro bono divorce case and was extremely proud.  When Maddie returned home on Sunday, they sat in her room for hours talking about the festival and how her weekend had been.  She casually threw in that she wanted to go trail riding soon before Maddie went back to school.</p>
        
        <p>The following Monday, Ann went in for chemo but they said she was too weak for it.  The next two days she stayed home from work.  On Wednesday, July 18, 2012, Ann was in too much pain to stay at home.  She hugged her daughter goodbye and told her she loved her.  Maddie told her she loved Ann and wished her luck.  Ann’s husband Rudy took Ann to Lahey Clinic in Burlington, MA and she was admitted for surgery.  While waiting to be taken in, Ann insisted on looking over all the forms she had to sign and stated “I’m a lawyer,” for her reason.  She came out of surgery early Thursday morning in a medically induced coma.</p>
        
        <p>It was soon apparent that Ann would never wake up and she was surrounded by her family and friends.  On Tuesday, July 24, 2012, Ann was taken off life support.  Her room was full of her loved ones.  For the next week, there was never a moment when she was alone.</p>
