        <h2>A New Start</h2>
        
        <p>In 1981, after Ann returned from Washington, she moved to Boston with her friend Jamie from college.  She was set up on a blind date by her roommate and her boyfriend who, at the time who was Ann’s future husband’s roommate.  Ann called Rudy Kallock from a payphone and arranged their first date.  Ann and Rudy along with Jamie and Larry would go to a Patriots game.  </p>
        
        <p>For the next two years, Ann and Rudy fell in love and in 1982 at a restaurant in Cambridge Albert (Rudy) Kallock asked Ann Frances Sweeny to marry him.  She said yes.  In the spring of 1983, Ann married Rudy Kallock surrounded by family and friends.  </p>
        
        <h2>Time To Add One More</h2>
        
        <p>In 1990, Ann became pregnant after many years of trying.  She was elated to finally be pregnant.  On the night of Monday, October 28, 1991, Ann went into labor while waiting for her husband to return home from tennis.  She was on the phone with her friend Ellen while watching Murphy Brown.  Rudy arrived home soon after and drove her from their Hudson, MA home to Emerson Hospital in Concord, MA.  Rudy sat in the waiting room until they called him in.  The Raiders and Chiefs were playing each other on Monday night football.</p>
        
        <p>At 5:27 a.m. on the morning of Tuesday, October 29, 1991, Ann gave birth to their baby girl Madeline Grace Kallock.  She was a healthy baby girl and Ann and Rudy could not have been happier. </p>
        
        <p>That morning, on the way home, Rudy stopped at McDonald’s and ‘Your Song’ by Elton John was playing on the radio.  That became Madeline’s song.  </p>
        
        <p>A few days later, Ann and Rudy brought their baby home to join their Airedale Astro and their cat Kiwi.  </p>

        <h2>Work Life</h2>
        
        <h3>Boston College Library</h3>
        
        <p>After graduating from the University of Washington, she moved back to Massachusetts and started working at the Boston College library in 1981.  She met her future husband that same year.</p>
        
        <h3>Harvard Law Library</h3>
        
        <p>After leaving Boston College in 1983, she started working at Harvard.  They offered to pay for half her tuition if she went back to school. From 1983 to 1986, Ann attended night school at Simmons College while working her days at the Harvard Law library.</p>
        <h3>Digital</h3>
        
        <p>After getting her Library Science degree, Ann started working at Digital in Acton, MA.  She worked in the library/research department.  Ann worked here for 12 years until the company became defunct.  Through her time here, Ann made many friends and changed lives.  One of her best friends Ellen Gilliam still fondly tells stories of Ann and her days at Digital.</p>
        
        <h3>Hill Holiday Advertising Agency</h3>
        
        <h3>Dialog</h3>
        
        <h3>St. Gobain</h3>
        
        <h3>Annette Gonthier-Kiely & Associates</h3>
        
        <p>Annette Gonthier is easily one of the most terrible people to ever live.  She was a satanic and abusive boss.  She was brilliant but she was selfish and insensitive.  When Ann needed to take time off to go to the doctor, Annette would not allow it.  Ann had to say that there was a death in the family to get time off to go to the doctor.</p>
        
        <h2>4 Years Later...</h2>
        
        <p>After four long years at Suffolk Law School, Ann finally graduated.  She walked across the stage after almost not making it there at all.  The night before, she had been at the hospital with her father who was sick.  She walked across the stage without her glasses (and she was blind as a bat) with the biggest smile on her face.</p>
        
        <p>After the ceremony was over, she hugged her core law school friends and celebrated with her family and friends on her huge achievement.</p>

        <p>On Father’s Day (June 21, 2009) in the middle of Ann studying for the bar, her father passed away.  She still continued to catch up with her classes online while helping her mother plan all the arrangements.  She took the bar and was as nervous as could be.</p>
        
        <p>Three months later, on October 28, 2009, Ann got her results back.  She had passed the bar on her first try.  There are more people that fail on their first attempt that pass the bar.</p>
